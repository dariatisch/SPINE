**Info:** 
We are pleased to announce the Spring School on Perceptions of Wealth Inequality, funded by the Volkswagen Foundation. This interdisciplinary research incubator aims to explore perceptions of wealth inequality from different perspectives. The Spring School will bring together young scholars and established experts from diverse fields such as political and communication science, economics, history, and sociology.

Why Perceptions of Wealth Inequality?
Across different social groups and countries, individuals often perceive the distribution of wealth wrong. This applies to estimating their view of their own wealth relative to the society they live in but also to the overall situation in this society, i.e., the level of economic inequality, and its consequences for individual life courses. Such misperceptions and more generally perceptions of wealth have far-reaching consequences, as it is the perceived inequality, rather than the actual inequality, that may shape redistributive preferences and, consequently, one's stance on policy measures. Through deliberation and decision making these stances, in turn, will impact policy making, institutional organisation, and hence the actual inequality as well as its perceptions.

**Key Objectives**
1.	**Skill Development**: Participants will gain valuable skills through project-based learning and collaboration with experts.
2.	**Trans-Disciplinary Networking and Collaboration**: The school builds bridges across diverse fields, such as political and communication science, economics, history, and sociology, fostering dialogue and cross-fertilisation between these traditionally parallel disciplines. Furthermore, the school features dedicated exchange with public stakeholders to kick-start policy-oriented thinking.
3.	**Research Output**: Findings of successful projects will be published in a special issue in the journal **Historical Social Research**.
4.	**Inform the Public Discourse**: Executive summaries will be shared on the established platform ungleichheit.info.


### **The School as a Research Incubator**
The school will not focus on traditional teaching elements such as lectures  or seminars/tutorials. Instead, the two weeks in Bamberg will mostly comprise intense project work: There will be seven projects led by senior experts, which examine different aspects of inequality perceptions using various methods specifically fit for their respective research puzzles. Each participant will join one of these projects. Together, the project teams will work on their project throughout the school, making serious progress towards a publishable research paper. Along the way, participants will learn (more deeply) about the methods they use and the specific topic they study.

### **The Projects**


**(Self-)perceptions of the global business elite**

Diliara Valeeva, Amsterdam Institute for Social Science Research and Data Science Centre, University of Amsterdam

This project will investigate the self-perceptions of the rich and their conscious or subconscious impact on business and policy making. The research understands these as emerging from interactions of wealthy people with their peers, namely at corporate board meetings. It will construct and analyse networks of people cooperating on corporate boards, analyse co-occurrence and differences in corporate policy in cross-section and longitudinally, and characterise individual board members. To operationalise this mixed-method approach, the expert will prepare data (sources) based on their previous experience with similar studies.

**Attitudes towards wealth inequality and redistribution**

Nhat An Trinh, Institute for New Economic Thinking, Department of Social Policy and Intervention and Nuffield College, University of Oxford

This project focuses on how citizens perceive (i) the distribution of wealth within society and (ii) the role of the state and family in affecting this distribution. Despite extensive research on redistributive preferences, the nexus between perceptions of wealth inequality and preferences for its (re-) distribution is not systematically understood. On the one hand, perceptions of wealth inequality may drive support for the state to redistribute wealth across households by means of taxation. On the other hand, these perceptions may affect attitudes towards wealth transfers made within families through financial gifts and inheritances. Since how far perceptions of wealth inequality influence redistributive preferences is grounded in historical, contextual, and cultural factors (e.g. property regimes, inheritance customs, meritocratic beliefs, opportunities for upward mobility), this project examines granular data on the regional level on attitudes, perceptions, fairness evaluations and voting behaviour from survey and experimental sources and how these are linked to perceptions of wealth inequality. By doing so, this project contributes to a better understanding of the so-called “paradox of redistribution”, i.e., why rising pre-tax inequality rarely translates into increased redistribution. The expert leading the group is building on her extensive experience with regional data in this context.

**Media representations of German immigrants in the U.S.**

Liane Rothenberger, Department for Communication Science, KU Eichstätt-Ingolstadt & Kevin Grieves, Communication Studies Department, Whitworth University Spokane

This project investigates how American newspapers covered immigration of German citizens into the US. Our focus will be on immigrant groups that came to the United States during the 19th century, above all after the European revolutions of 1848-1849. How did the immigrants, many of them arriving in poverty, come to wealth? How were their efforts perceived by the wider public? Together, we will content analyze historical newspaper articles and qualitatively examine coverage narratives and framing. We will evaluate if, and if yes, to which extent, wealth might be connected to perceptions of education, religion, morality and diligence. This project will contribute valuable historical context to our understanding of contemporary journalistic discourses surrounding perceptions of wealth related to immigrant groups.

**Agent-based simulation of perceptions of wealth**

Jan Lorenz, Social Data Science, Constructor University Bremen

The paper aims to formalise some of the empirical channels behind misperceptions using computer simulations. Recent work demonstrates that endogenously evolving reference groups emerging e.g. from residential segregation based on class can be important drivers of misperceptions. Yet, these explanatory attempts are purely static and could be extended by adding a purposive element allowing agents to adapt their perceptions in light of new information. The foundational bounded confidence model can be used to study the dynamic effects of opinion adaptation with initial misperceptions. The framework is sufficiently flexible to include both local biases based on individual social networks that differentially affect agents and global signals based, e.g. on media coverage that are both well documented in the extant literature. The group working on simulations will apply this so-called bounded-confidence framework to examine which types of perception biases lead to which outcomes, i.e., a state of consensus, persistent fluctuations or stable opinion polarisation. In this way, the simulations can also generate novel hypotheses on the relationship between types of misperceptions, opinion adaptation and long-term outcomes that might be fruitfully applied to more empirically oriented studies.

**Public debates and statistical wealth surveys in the long 20th century in Germany**

Eva Gajek, Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies, Cologne

The project investigates the connection between statistical surveys of wealth and their scientific and public discussions in the long 20th century in Germany. How and when were numerical surveys of wealth problematized, when did they lead to scandals and how and when did a broad public use figures to communicate about its social structure? The project focuses on three time periods: from the turn of the century to 1914, from the 1960s/to 1970s and from 2001-2010. All three periods were characterized by a strong public discussion about wealth inequality after statistical figures were published and provoked a broad, but also scientific debate that problematized or scandalized the published figures. The empirical basis of the project is a wide range of source material such as statistical surveys, media texts, but also scientific studies.

### **No participation fee, accommodation provided!**
Accommodation (one-bed rooms) and meals (three/day) will be provided during the school free of charge to all participants. Participants must pay for their own travel costs. We have limited funding to support participants who can otherwise not get their travel expenses reimbursed. For sustainability reasons, we will not cover flights.

**Apply Now – Deadline: August 31, 2024**

We invite applications from advanced master students,  PhD students and  early-career researchers. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study. There are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. About 20 participants will be invited.
For a successful application, you do not need to be an expert on wealth inequality perceptions,  nor on the methods to be applied. Yet, you should demonstrate your commitment and ability to quickly gather the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively participate.
Together with the experts, we will evaluate applications based on the likelihood that the applicant will contribute to the success of the project and everyone else’s educational experience as well as the likelihood of the participant to benefit from participating in terms of their learning and networking. We will take into account the applicant's career stage and previous educational opportunities. To apply, please fill in this form, which contains a few questions on your background and asks for a short statement of motivation (max. 500 words) which details your commitment to actively participate in the research incubator:
