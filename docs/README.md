# SPINE
## Research Incubators on perceptions of wealth (inequality)


**Date:**
March 17 â€“ March 28, 2025

**Venue:**
University of Bamberg, Markusplatz 3, Bamberg, Germany

**Organizers:**  
Prof. Dr. Daniel Mayerhoffer, University of Amsterdam  
Dr. Jan Schulz-Gebhard, University of Bamberg  
Dr. Daria Tisch, Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies (MPIfG)


**Call for participants:**  July 2024  


**Info:** 
The spring school will take the form of a research incubator and delve into the complex issue of wealth inequality perceptions, especially in welfare states like Germany. 
This interdisciplinary initiative is designed as a collaborative melting pot where young scholars and established experts will jointly explore this multidimensional topic using a wide array of methods, from qualitative methods to panel regression analyses. 
The research incubator will nurture seven diverse projects, all focusing on different aspects of wealth inequality perceptions. This approach seeks to build bridges across diverse fields, such as political and communication science, economics and sociology, fostering dialogue and cross-fertilisation between these traditionally parallel disciplines. 
Furthermore, practice stakeholders working on percep-ions of wealth inequality will join the school for a panel discussion and to provide feedback on the subprojects.
Embedded within the broader debate on wealth (re-)production systems and institutions, this research incubator will cultivate an environment for an in-depth study of perception biases and the formation of justifying ideologies among different socioeconomic strata. 
A central goal is to generate new insights into whether (mis)perceptions of wealth inequality serve as barriers or catalysts to societal transformation processes.


The Spring School on perceptions of wealth inequality (SPINE) is funded by the Volkswagen Foundation.
