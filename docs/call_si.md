# Call for Papers: Perceptions of Wealth Inequality 

## Call for papers for a special issue in Historical Social Research

edited by Daniel Mayerhoffer (University of Amsterdam), Jan Schulz (University of Bamberg) and Daria Tisch (Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies, Cologne) 


Across different social groups and countries, individuals perceive the extent of economic inequalities such as wealth inequality spectacularly wrong. This applies to estimating their view of their own wealth relative to the society they live in but also to the overall situation in this society, i.e., the level of economic inequality, and its consequences for individual life courses. Perceptions of wealth are crucial as they can influence attitudes towards redistribution, shape public support for policy measures, and affect social cohesion. Although the literature provides evidence for the existence and the relevance of these misperception phenomena, perceptions of wealth (inequality) are yet understudied empirically as well as theoretically across disciplines. 

The special issue seeks to consolidate diverse methodological and theoretical approaches to provide a comprehensive understanding of how perceptions of economic inequality, with a particular focus on wealth disparities, are formed, maintained, and challenged. By offering insights into the mechanisms driving these perceptions, we aim to better understand their role in shaping individual behaviour and collective policy decisions.  We welcome contributions that engage with the complex interplay between perceived and actual inequality, as well as the channels through which perceptions shape policy preferences, institutional dynamics, and societal outcomes. Submissions from all disciplinary backgrounds are welcome, including theoretical contributions and studies using diverse methodological approaches such as experimental studies, qualitative research, survey-based analyses, computational methods, or mixed-methods designs.
